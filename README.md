# [HTML Starter Kit](https://github.com/mhulse/html-starter-kit)

**A variety of “real-world” HTML(5) markup examples (plus a few extras).**

**Useful as a “kit” page.** Use the html found in [`index.html`](index.html) as a starting point for your theme’s base styles. Add custom elements to this document as you see fit.

Check out the [un-styled demo page](http://mhulse.github.io/html-starter-kit/kit/).
